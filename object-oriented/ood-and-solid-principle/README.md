# OOD and SOLID Principle

[SOLID](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) is the initial letter of five object oriented design principles  


* **S: Single Responsibility Principle\(SRP\)** It states _"a class or interface should have only one reason to change"_, which means every class or interface should have a single responsibility or single purpose
* **O: Open/Closed Principle\(OCP\)** It states that _"software entities\(classes, modules, functions, etc\)"_ should be open for extension, but closed for modification. It means that you should be able to extend a class behavior without modifying it
* **L: Liskov's Substitution Principle\(LSP\)** Barbara Liskov introduced this principle in 1987, which states that _"Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it"._ This principle means that any child class should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behavior
* **I: Interface Segregation Principle\(ISP\)** "do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them". An interface concentrates in on goal rather than covers every functionalities in general.
* **D: Dependency Inversion Principle\(DIP\)** High level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on the abstraction. Abstraction should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
