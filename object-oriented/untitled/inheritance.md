# Inheritance

It is the mechanism that supports code reusability in Java. One class is allowed to inherit the features of another class. The **super class** contains the features to be inherited, and the **sub class** inherits the methods from the super class. 

* Java classes are single inheritance, which means it does not support multiple inheritance with classes, but interface can inherit multiple interface
* An interface can inherit multiple interfaces Interface C **extends** A, B {} 
* A class can implement multiple interfaces Class C **implements** A, B {}
* A class can only inherit exact one class Class B **extends** A {}

* **super** keyword is used for calling the parent class method/constructor
