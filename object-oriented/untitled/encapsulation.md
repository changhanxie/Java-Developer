# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data into a single unit. We can think it as a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield

* The variables or data in a class is hidden from other classes  and can be accessed only through its own member methods is called encapsulated
* Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the variables or methods in the class with **private** access modifier and writing public **setter\(\)** and **getter\(\)** methods to set and to get the values of the variables.
