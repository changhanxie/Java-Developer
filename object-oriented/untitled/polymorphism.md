# Polymorphism

Polymorphism basically means same name but different forms.

* **Overloading** is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name but their argument lists are different. C**onstructor overloading** is an example of method overloading in Java. It allows a Java class has more than one constructor with each of them having different number or type of arguments.

example

* **Overriding** allows a child class to implement methods that is being provided by its parent class. The methods will have the exact same name and parameters as in its parent class, only the details can be changed. Those overriding methods can return different type of values with a specific limitation.

example

#### Overloading V.S. Overriding

* Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters or different types. Overriding means that two methods have the same name and parameters with the same name and type. One method is in the parent class and another one is in the child class. The method in the child class will change the behavior of the one in the parent class.
